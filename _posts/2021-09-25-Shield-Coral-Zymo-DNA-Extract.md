# DNA Extraction Protocol For the Zymo Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus [kit](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/company-protocols/_d4068_d4069_quick-dna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) On Corals Stored in DNA/RNA Shield and Frozen at -20

**Homogenization and Incubation**

- Thaw the samples on ice
- Sample tubes should contain tissue piece and ~500ul of DNA/RNA Shield
- Add 150ul of ultra pure molecular grade water to each 1.5 ml tube
- Add 150ul of Solid Tissue Buffer (blue) to each 1.5mL tube
- Add 10ul proteinase K to each 1.5mL tube
- Vortex 1.5mL tubes and spin down briefly
- Start the thermomixer and set to 55 degrees C
- Place samples in the thermomixer and set the shaking speed to 600rpm
- Incubate samples in the thermomixer for 5 hours (time can be increased or decreased: troubleshoot this step for your samples/species)

**DNA Extraction**

- Label final 1.5mL tubes per sample
- Warm DNA Elution Buffer or 10mM Tris HCl to 70 degrees C in the thermomixer (you'll need 100ul per sample)
- After incubation, centrifuge tubes at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute to pellet any debris and beads you may have sucked up
- Remove supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes (this should be about 200-300ul). Discard the tube from incubation
- Add equal volume (200-300µl) Genomic Binding Buffer to each 1.5mL tube
- Vortex each 1.5mL tube to mix
- Spin down each 1.5mL tube in the minifuge to collect the liquid
- Set up one spin column and collection tube per sample
- Add 400ul of sample (not all the volume) to the spin column
- Centrifuge spin columns at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Discard the collection tube and use a new one
- Add the remainder of the liquid from the 1.5mL tubes to the spin columns
- Centrifuge spin columns at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Discard the collection tube and use a new one
- Add 400µl DNA Pre-Wash Buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuge columns at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through into a liquid waste beaker
- Add 700µl G-DNA Wash Buffer to spin columns
- Centrifuge columns at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through into a liquid waste beaker
- Add 200µl G-DNA Wash Buffer to columns
- Centrifuge columns at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Pour off flow through into a liquid waste beaker and discard the collection tube
- Transfer spin columns to the final labeled 1.5mL tubes
- Add 50ul warmed 70 degrees C DNA Elution Buffer or 10mM Tris-HCl directly to the column filter
- Incubate the columns at room temp for 5 minutes on the bench
- Centrifuge columns at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Again add 50ul warmed 70 degrees C DNA Elution Buffer or 10mM Tris-HCl directly to the column filter
- Incubate the columns at room temp for 5 minutes on the bench
- Centrifuge columns at 12,000 rcf for 1 minute
- Aliquot 8ul of the DNA into strip tubes for QC analysis
- Freeze the 1.5mL tubes at -20
- Keep the strip tube aliquots on ice if doing QC the same day, or freeze at -20 if doing another day

### QC

**Qubit: Broad Range DNA**  
- Follow Qubit [protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/DNA_Quality_Control/Qubit-Assay-Protocol.md)
- Read samples twice and average readings
- Make sure to record standards

**DNA Gel**
- Follow [Gel Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/DNA_Quality_Control/Agrose-Gel-Protocol.md)
- Suggestions are to:
  - Make a 1% gel and run for 1hr at 100V
  - Use 3ul 1kb plus DNA ladder
  - Use gel green
